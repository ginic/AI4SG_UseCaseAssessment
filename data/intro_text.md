## About the AI for Social Good Project Assessment Tool
When defining use cases that could be addressed with technology, including AI, machine learning, or automation, the first step is to clearly understand the problem. In many cases, what is initially assumed to be the problem turns out to be only a symptom rather than the root cause. Designing a solution for the wrong problem wastes valuable resources and often leads to disappointment when the expected impact does not materialize.

A solid problem definition is therefore essential. There are several open-source guides and worksheets available that help organizations uncover the real issue and formulate a precise problem statement. These tools encourage structured thinking and prevent jumping to solutions too early.

Spring Impact is a social impact organization that helps nonprofits and NGOs scale their impact. They provide practical tools and resources, like the problem definition toolkit. Their problem definition worksheet is designed to help organizations clearly identify the real problem, its root causes, and its consequences so that teams can focus on the right issue and make well-informed, strategic decisions.

This process of problem definition and use case selection works best through conversation rather than surveys. Surveys tend to capture surface-level answers, while face-to-face discussions allow for deeper exploration, clarification, and trust-building. Speaking directly with those who experience the issue every day, the problem owners, reveals nuances that written responses often miss. The purpose of these conversations is not only to collect information but also to help the stakeholder reflect on what the problem truly is. An interviewer, committed to diving deeper, can guide this process by asking the right questions and probing for details.
The interviewer should ideally be someone within the organization who has a basic understanding of IT and business processes, such as a business analyst, and who can act as a bridge between the business and technology teams. Their role is to create an open dialogue, ask structured questions that uncover pain points and root causes, and document insights that will later inform whether technology, including AI or automation, can provide value.

Taking this approach ensures that any proposed use case is grounded in real organizational needs, aligned with organizational priorities, and feasible given available data and resources. It is not simply about finding problems, it is about finding the right problems and the solutions to solve them.

## How to use this website
Each page of the assessment tool contains questions to about the project idea or problem you are hoping to solve. Select an option for each question, then go on to the next page. You may use the sidebar or buttons on the bottom to navigate between pages.

On the final page, your answers will be analyzed on various dimensions of organizational and technical readiness to help you understand how challenging or ambitious your project idea may be.
